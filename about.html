     <p>Introduction: The name of our country is Bangladesh.It became independent in 1971 through a bloody liberation war. About thirty lakhs men and women laid down their lives for the cause of independence. It is one most beautiful countries of the world, with its green fields and lots of trees and plants.<br>

     Situation and its area: Bangladesh lies in the eastern part of South Asia. It is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal in the south and borders on India and Myanmar in the cast, and only India in the west. Its total land area including rivers is 147.570 square kilometers.<br>

     Its population: Bangladesh is a small country. But it has a big -population. There are about one hundred and twenty million people living this small land. Here the density of population is high. About 800 people live per square kilometer. Bangladesh is mainly an agricultural country and most of its people are farmers.<br>

     Main Crops and Fruits: The soil of Bangladesh is very fertile. It gets lots of rain and sunshine. So, rice, jute, sugar-cane, and tea grow abundantly here. Many kinds of fruits also grow in Bangladesh. Of them, jackfruits, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, guavas, and water-melons are most famous.<br>

     Main rivers: Bangladesh is called the land of rivers. It is crisscrossed by hundreds of big and small rivers. Of them, the Padma the Jamuna, the Meghna, the Brahmaputra, and the Karnafully are worth mentioning.<br>

     Natural beauties: Bangladesh is known as the darling child of Nature. There are many interesting places with scenic beauty here. The Sundarbans, Rangamati and the tea gardens of Sylhet are very Attractive. The Coxâ€™s Bazar Sea beach, which is 120 kilometers long, is the longest beach in the world. The beach with its green background looks very charming.<br>

     Conclusion: Though Bangladesh is an uncommonly beautiful country, most of its people live below the poverty line. They work very hard, yet they do not have enough to eat. The reason is that we are too many people for this small land. However, our government has started a campaign for poverty. Alleviation and some pragmatic steps have been taken in this respect. We hope that our country will be free from hunger and poverty by the early part of the 2Ist century.</p><br>
